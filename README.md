# Styx Companion App

This React-Native app is the companion app for the Styx Device that was being developed. This project was not completed because it came to our attention that Juul, a multi-billion dollar e-cigarette company, had released patents and announced a product that was very similar to our own. We realized it was unlikely that we would be able to develop this full product and launch it in time to be in competition with Juul.

Previews of the app can be found at on the [Styx Website](https://styxhealth.com)

NOTE: This was my first project using React, so I did not fully understand many of the design principles and conventions of React. As a result, there are some bad practices found in the source code such as directly maniuplating the state and overuse of the forceUpdate() method.
